The first language that was taught to me was C, so you can say that I've been through fire. At the age of 18, I moved to Canada 🇨🇦 where I currently work and live.\n\nOne thing I learned from all these experiences is: \"There is always a more efficient way to do something\". Because of that:\n\n* You can frequently see me making changes to my personal projects 👨‍💻, be it editing wiki pages or completely reconfiguring its folder structure. I believe that perfection isn't achieved in one go, but in small, incremental accomplishments.\n* Occasionally, I write ✍ an article in DEV.to about a framework I have been playing around with, or an industry topic that I find interesting. \n\nWhen I'm not coding, you can find me playing video games 🎮 or reading some books 📚. \n\nThis portfolio is built with Gatsby, [Rebass](https://jxnblk.com/rebass/) for mobile-responsive components and [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) to manage the contents on this web app!"
